# Trash Image Classification Model

This project classifies images of trash into 9 categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Folder structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (main notebook: `CNN_classification_model_mvp.ipynb`)
- `src/` → Python scripts supporting model training and preprocessing

## How to run
1. Open `notebooks/CNN_classification_model_mvp.ipynb`.
2. Follow instructions for data loading, preprocessing, and training.
3. Outputs include classification metrics and example predictions.

## Notes
- Dataset contains 9 trash categories.
- CNN architecture: [briefly describe if you want, e.g., layers, optimizer].
- All code is written in Python 3.12 with TensorFlow/Keras.
